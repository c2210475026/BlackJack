### Rules of Black Jack
The players get two cards. The Dealer gets two cards as well.
One face up and the other face down. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, 
and face cards (jack, queen, king) are also worth 10. An ace's value is 11 unless this would cause the player to bust,
in which case it is worth 1.

Blackjack hands are scored by their point total.
The hand with the highest total wins as long as it doesn't exceed 21.
A hand with a higher total than 21 is said to bust. The goal of each player is to beat the dealer by having the higher, 
unbusted hand. If the player busts he loses, even if the dealer also busts.
If both the player and the dealer have the same point value, it is called a push,
and neither player nor dealer wins the hand. 

Each player has an independent game with the dealer,
so it is possible for the dealer to lose to one player, but still beat the other players in the same round.
